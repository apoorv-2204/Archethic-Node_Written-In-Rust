# This is unofficial implementation of Archethic Node In Rust
---


## Why?
- Rust dont have garbage collector as compared to Elixir and go
- Memory Safe 
- Rust is best for performance, and for low  powered pc it is the best.
- For a Solana like node requirements, Elixir will do well, but thats not the aim
- Aenode aims to run on any device, we need to provide that performance using rust
- Performance similar to C, > 30x Elixir and 1x-3x  Go
- Elixir is the lang of future , where the cpu performance saturates and all other languages performance becomes constant, that future is no where close(nb of cpu and in ghz)

## One step a time
I am novice in  rust, but aim to learn and do as we go by the refactor. With baby steps, we shall conquer the moutain too. We will follow polkadot rust codebase as main source of inspiration.
